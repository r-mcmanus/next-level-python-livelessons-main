# Locating Python on your computer
If you are trying to find the location of Python3 on your computer,
try these locations first.
The exact location and filename will depend
on the method you used to install Python
and which version is installed.

## Windows
Look for `python.exe`
- C:\Python36
- C:\Program Files\Python36
- C:\Users\\*username*\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-XX

## Mac
Look for `python3.6` or `python3`

- /usr/local/bin
- /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/
- /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.X_X/bin/
- /Users/*username*/anaconda/bin/
- /anaconda3/bin/

## Linux
Look for `python3.6` or `python3`
- /usr/bin/
- /usr/local/bin

### Finally
If you didn't find it at any of these locations,
try searching google more specifically based on
your Python version, operating system, and method of download.

If you found it at another location, please email me at
